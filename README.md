# IoT-Robot-with-Telematics
This project features an autonomous robot powered by the ESP32 microcontroller, equipped with an ultrasonic sensor for obstacle avoidance and a DHT11 sensor for environmental monitoring. The ESP32 hosts a local Wi-Fi web server to display real-time temperature and humidity data through a clean, auto-refreshing dashboard.
